## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than computing itrepeatedly.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  i <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    i <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function()x
  setInverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
  getInverse <- function() i 
  list(set = set, get = get, 
       setInverse = setInverse, 
       getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(i)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  i <- solve(mat,...)
  x$setInverse(i)
  i
}
